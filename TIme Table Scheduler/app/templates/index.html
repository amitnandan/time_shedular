  <p>A timetable is needed at every possible place to manage the flow of the duties.  Timetable Scheduling jobs are one of the most plodding jobs in the present time.  There are a number of considerations to be kept in mind to generate an effective timetable.  Basically, timetables are needed in educational institutions, where the sole consideration of the schedulers is the overall development of the pupils by giving apt amount of importance and time to the subjects.  These timetables are designed by the teachers in such a way that there is equal distribution of work according to the curriculum.  In such surge of technology even today, timetables are scheduled manually by the means of trial and error procedure, thereby consuming more time and increasing the workload of the scheduler.  There are a number of permutations and combinations required to get the desired outcome class-wise.  Our project is designed to pacify this wearisome task.  Timetable Scheduler(TTS) is an application to automatically generate timetables in an open-ended manner in comparison to other timetable schedulers present.  Since it's developed as a web application it out-stands to be a platform independent application.  With some requisite modifications the application's dynamic behaviour can be improved inorder to make it compatible for different colleges to schedule their timetable as per their desideratum.  The application is keenly scrutinized with some pre-scheduled timetables to manifest it's cogency.  It has legibly shown positive and expected upshots adding to the efficacious ability of the application.</p>
